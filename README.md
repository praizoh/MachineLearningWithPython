###Why I strted Machine Learning??
I am currently working on a project and from the look of things the way around what I will need to achieve the features of the project is machine learning.
After much procrastination, I decided to look up machine learning courses for beginners. I came across several resources online including "10 Best Machine Learning Courses to Take in 2022" (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/best-machine-learning-courses/)

Not taken of the courses in the url above though they were intriguing. I went for "Into to Machine Learning" on udacity and I must say its been an interesting experience so far. 

I will be posting my progress here as I go. I hope to check other resources too.
